<h1>🗒️Templates & Documentation - Work in Action! </h1>
<h2>Structure & Adaptability</h2>

<h3>Different Formats for Different Organizations</h3>
<p>Project documentation formats can vary significantly depending on the organization. Larger companies often have established templates and documentation standards that you’ll need to follow, while in smaller organizations or new projects, you may have to create your own templates from scratch.</p>

<p>I’ve worked within both structures, and the key isn’t just knowing the format—it’s understanding the underlying concepts and adapting to the structure while helping shape the necessary artifacts.</p>

<h3>The BA’s Role in Documentation</h3>
<p><strong>Remember, Business Analysts don’t just create documents</strong>—our job is to <strong>gather, analyze, validate, and structure insights</strong> from stakeholders to give form to these deliverables.</p>

<p>And most importantly, <strong>we are not the final users of these documents</strong>. We craft them to <strong>translate information for each team member</strong>, ensuring that every stakeholder gets what they need in a format they can understand. Our role is to <strong>bridge gaps, clarify needs, and support decision-making</strong>—not just to fill out templates.</p>

<h2>📌 Understanding Documentation Through a Common Example</h2>

<p>To keep things simple and easy to follow, I’ve selected a common and straightforward functionality: <strong>User Login</strong>. I’ll use this example across different types of documents so you can see how the same information is structured in various formats.</p>

<p>This will help you understand how documentation adapts depending on the purpose, audience, and organizational standards.</p>
